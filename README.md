A minimal chialisp debug example
===

Showing path resolution, argument decoding, stepping through programs.

Use with the chialisp debug adapter in vscode (and possibly other debug adapter consumers).
The debug adapter uses chialisp.json to resolve include directories as does the language
server.

A makefile is provided which can rebuild the hex and symbol output.
